This is a simple project that will model the assets and liabilities of a insurance company over time. 
The idea is to set up a simple DFA and gradually enhance the features and complexity of the model. 

Ultimatly the goal is to have what is called an ALS model that takes into account all of the interactions between assets and liabilities for insurance products. 

First we will focus on a very simple product that has very few elements of interaction with the assets; A term insurance.
